    "about_sector" => "Many of the charity’s activities serve a dual purpose of raising funds and changing our clients lives through our flagship TEN – Training, Enterprise, Nurture – scheme. 63 people benefited from this scheme in 2014-15.
Some of our clients self-refer, some are referred by other agencies familiar with the range of services we offer.",

    "about_last" => "In turn, The River Manchester can act as a gateway to services that we do not directly provide – safe refuge, housing, benefits and immigration services and so on.
We provide in-house training, self-development opportunities, inspiration, counsel and both job-seeking and employability skills for individuals whose confidence and faith in life has often been severely damaged.
At our base in Openshaw, our busy and well-stocked shop is seen by the local community as a valuable source of low-cost quality items. Here you can furnish your house, equip your kitchen or fill your wardrobe!
Our in-house internet café offers hot and cold drinks, snacks and light meals; community and social links for local shoppers; as well as low-cost internet access, printing and photocopying services.
Our van is busy every day of the week, collecting from donors or delivering furniture and white goods to our customers around the Greater Manchester area.",

    "about_main" => " 
The shop, van and café are staffed by our clients, introducing them to new skills and experience and growing confidence, which they often develop into nationally-recognised qualifications, through the training links we can provide.
Whatever their situation, volunteers, clients and members of the local community know that we create a safe space where people can tell their stories, share their lives and make new connections
Please turn to the ‘Becoming a Supporter’ page for ways to help us continue and expand our work in the exciting ways we are currently envisaging.

You could be retired and looking for a fulfilling activity; unemployed and looking to increase your skills and employment prospects; or in work and taking part in your employer's Corporate Social Responsibility activities.
Bring your time, expertise or willingness to learn, and we can match you with a task from the range of activities in our shop, cafe, office, fund-raising or community outreach services. It could be ongoing work or a one-off project. It could be anything from mentoring volunteers in training; to working in the shop and helping customers; or decorating and gardening for someone in the community needing that support.
