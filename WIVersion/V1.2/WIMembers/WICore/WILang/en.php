Help The River Manchester maintain a secure financial footing by making a regular annual or monthly subscription to the charity to help us continue and expand our work in some of the exciting ways we are currently envisaging. We will keep you in touch with events and new developments via a quarterly Newsletter, and also offer you a 'Member's discount' of 10% off cafe or shop purchases.
",

	"shoping" => "–	Online Shopping. Did you know that you can get your favourite online retailers to donate to the charity at no cost to you? First go to easyfundraising.org.uk and create a free account. After that, each time you buy online, first log in to your easyfundraising account, click on the 'Causes' section and type in The River Manchester and press 'Support', then shop as you usually do. The retailer will automatically register your charity choice and make a donation to us. Simple – and it makes a real difference to people’s lives!",

If you are unable to make a regular commitment to support The River , you can still make cash donations when it suits you via BACS secure bank transfer, via Paypal, posting a cheque or even bringing cash into our shop, as some of our current supporters do!

OR donate pre-loved furniture, white goods, household and electrical items, clothes, books, toys and games (though no soft toys please!) and DVDs to help us keep our busy shop stocked. The local community values us as a source of low-cost quality items and we keep a 'wish list' of items that customers and clients are on the look-out for – help make someone's wish come true!

Use your own creativity, perhaps with some advice from us, to devise and host a money-raising event for The River Manchester or offer us the opportunity to make a presentation to your playgroup, PTA, or Rotary branch.

You could be retired and looking for a fulfilling activity; unemployed and looking to increase your skills and employment prospects; or in work and taking part in your employer's Corporate Social Responsibility activities.
Bring your time, expertise or willingness to learn, and we can match you with a task from the range of activities in our shop, cafe, office, fund-raising or community outreach services. It could be ongoing work or a one-off project. It could be anything from mentoring volunteers in training; to working in the shop and helping customers; or decorating and gardening for someone in the community needing that support.
