<h3>Become a Member</h3>

  <h3>Become a donor</h3>								
  <p>If you are unable to make a regular commitment to support The River , you can still make cash donations when it suits you via BACS secure bank transfer, via Paypal, posting a cheque or even bringing cash into our shop, as some of our current supporters do!

OR donate pre-loved furniture, white goods, household and electrical items, clothes, books, toys and games (though no soft toys please!) and DVDs to help us keep our busy shop stocked. The local community values us as a source of low-cost quality items and we keep a 'wish list' of items that customers and clients are on the look-out for – help make someone's wish come true!

  <h3>Become a Volunteer</h3>                
  <p>You could be retired and looking for a fulfilling activity; unemployed and looking to increase your skills and employment prospects; or in work and taking part in your employer's Corporate Social Responsibility activities.
Bring your time, expertise or willingness to learn, and we can match you with a task from the range of activities in our shop, cafe, office, fund-raising or community outreach services. It could be ongoing work or a one-off project. It could be anything from mentoring volunteers in training; to working in the shop and helping customers; or decorating and gardening for someone in the community needing that support.
